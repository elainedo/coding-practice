'''
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.

Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.

 

Example 1:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

Output: 8

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:

Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

Output: 6

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

Example 3:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

Output: 10

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

 

Constraints:

1 <= tasks.length <= 104
tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
0 <= n <= 100

'''
You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers tasks, representing tasks that need to be completed in order, where tasks[i] represents the type of the ith task.

You are also given a positive integer space, which represents the minimum number of days that must pass after the completion of a task before another task of the same type can be performed.

Each day, until all tasks have been completed, you must either:

Complete the next task from tasks, or
Take a break.
Return the minimum number of days needed to complete all tasks.

 

Example 1:

Input: tasks = [1,2,1,2,3,1], space = 3
Output: 9
Explanation:
One way to complete all tasks in 9 days is as follows:
Day 1: Complete the 0th task.
Day 2: Complete the 1st task.
Day 3: Take a break.
Day 4: Take a break.
Day 5: Complete the 2nd task.
Day 6: Complete the 3rd task.
Day 7: Take a break.
Day 8: Complete the 4th task.
Day 9: Complete the 5th task.
It can be shown that the tasks cannot be completed in less than 9 days.
Example 2:

Input: tasks = [5,8,8,5], space = 2
Output: 6
Explanation:
One way to complete all tasks in 6 days is as follows:
Day 1: Complete the 0th task.
Day 2: Complete the 1st task.
Day 3: Take a break.
Day 4: Take a break.
Day 5: Complete the 2nd task.
Day 6: Complete the 3rd task.
It can be shown that the tasks cannot be completed in less than 6 days.
 

Constraints:

1 <= tasks.length <= 105
1 <= tasks[i] <= 109
1 <= space <= tasks.length
